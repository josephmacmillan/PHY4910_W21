# Code Maintainers

In general, the job of the code maintainer, rotated weekly, is to make sure that the main branch has workable, reusable, and commented code from the work that we did during the week.  Use good file names, functions for code that might be repeated often, and so on.

## Schedule:

Week 2 - Georges - Maintain the phy4910.py file, which should at minimum contain a general function for solving ODEs using RK4.  If you want to add other convenience functions (e.g., for plotting), go for it.  Also, make sure there is working code for building a nonrelativistic white dwarf star, including calculating the mass and radius and plotting the radius versus radii.

Week 4 - Ryan - Maintin the phy4910.py file, which should now contain functions for building white dwarfs as (from previous work) as well as functions for picking random directions, optical depth, and moving photons.
