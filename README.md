# Code Maintainers

In general, the job of the code maintainer, rotated weekly, is to make sure that the main branch has workable, reusable, and commented code from the work that we did during the week.  Use good file names, functions for code that might be repeated often, and so on.

## Schedule:

Week 2 - Georges - Maintain the phy4910.py file, which should at minimum contain a general function for solving ODEs using RK4.  If you want to add other convenience functions (e.g., for plotting), go for it.  Also, make sure there is working code for building a nonrelativistic white dwarf star, including calculating the mass and radius and plotting the radius versus radii.

Week 4 - Ryan - Maintain the phy4910.py file, which should now contain functions for building white dwarfs as (from previous work) as well as functions for picking random directions, optical depth, and moving photons.

Week 5 - Alexis - Maintain the phy4910.py file.  At this point it's complete in terms of functions, but needs some things added:  
* Doc strings for each function
* Some print statements, using f strings, in places that are appropriate (e.g., where you want to give the user some information)
* A main function that only runs when the code is run directly; do some basic testing in the main function.
* Adapt solveODE to include a stopping function as we discussed in class (see Worksheet 6 and code for it here).

Week 7 - Sourav - Maintain code for Worksheets 8 and 9.  I recommend two files (worksheet8.py and worksheet9.py) that do all the things asked in the worksheets.  Make sure the code is well documented (doc strings, comments).
